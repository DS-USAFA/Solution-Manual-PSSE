# Additional Hypothesis Tests {#ADDTESTS}

## Objectives

1) Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test for equality of two or more means using both permutation and the $F$ distribution.   
2) Conduct and interpret a goodness of fit test using both Pearson's chi-squared and randomization to evaluate the independence between two categorical variables.   
3) Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test for the equality of two variances.   
4) Know and check assumptions for the tests in this lesson.

## Homework  

### Problem 1  

**Golf balls**   

Repeat the analysis of the golf ball problem from earlier this semester.


a. Load the data and tally the data into a table. The data is in `golf_balls.csv`.  

```{r message=FALSE}
golf_balls <- read_csv("data/golf_balls.csv")
```

```{r}
head(golf_balls)
```


```{r}
tally(~number,data=golf_balls)
```


b. Using the function `chisq.test` conduct a hypothesis test of equally likely distribution of balls. You may have to read the help menu. 


```{r}
chisq.test(tally(~number,data=golf_balls),p=c(.25,.25,.25,.25))
```


c. Repeat part b. but assume balls with the numbers 1 and 2 occur 30\% of the time and balls with 3 and 4 occur 20\%. 

```{r}
chisq.test(tally(~number,data=golf_balls),p=c(.3,.3,.2,.2))
```


### Problem 2

**Bootstrap hypothesis testing**  

Repeat the analysis of the MLB data from the lesson but this time generate a bootstrap distribution of the $F$ statistic.

First, read in the data.

```{r message=FALSE}
mlb_obp <- read_csv("data/mlb_obp.csv")
```

Convert `position` to a factor.

```{r}
mlb_obp <- mlb_obp %>%
  mutate(position=as.factor(position))
```

Summarize the data.

```{r}
favstats(obp~position,data=mlb_obp)
```

We need a function to resample the data, we will use the `resample()` from the `mosaic` package.


```{r}
library(broom)
```

```{r}
f_boot <- function(x){
  aov(obp~position,data=resample(x)) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  summarize(stat=meansq[1]/meansq[2]) %>%
  pull()
}
```


```{r cache=TRUE}
set.seed(541)
results<-do(1000)*f_boot(mlb_obp)
```

Let's plot our sampling distribution.

```{r}
results %>%
  gf_histogram(~f_boot,fill="cyan",color="black") %>%
  gf_theme(theme_classic()) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Bootstrap sampling distribution of F test statistic",
          x="Test statistic")
```  

Now the confidence interval for the F-statistic is:

```{r}
cdata(~f_boot,data=results)
```

We are 95\% confident that the $F$ statistic is in the interval $(0.35,8.72)$ which includes 1 so we fail to reject the null hypothesis of equal means. Remember under the null hypothesis the ratio of the variance between means to the pooled variance within categories should be 1. 

### Problem 3  

**Test of variance**

We have not performed a test of variance so we will create our own.

a. Using the MLB from the lesson, subset on `IF` and `OF`.  

```{r}
mlb_prob3 <- mlb_obp %>%
  filter(position=="IF"|position=="OF") %>%
  droplevels()
```

```{r}
summary(mlb_prob3)
```  

The function `droplevels()` gets rid of `C` and `DH` in the factor levels.

b. Create a side-by-side boxplot.

```{r}
mlb_prob3 %>%
  gf_boxplot(obp~position) %>%
  gf_theme(theme_classic())
```  

The hypotheses are:  
$H_0$: $\sigma^2_{IF}=\sigma^2{OF}$. There is no difference in the variance of on base percentage for infielders and outfielders.  
$H_A$: $\sigma^2_{IF}\neq \sigma^2_{OF}$. There is a difference in variances.
 
c. Use the differences in sample standard deviations as your test statistic. Using a permutation test, find the p-value and discuss your decision.  

```{r}
mlb_prob3 %>%
  group_by(position) %>%
  summarize(stat=sd(obp))
```


```{r}
obs <- mlb_prob3 %>%
  summarize(stat=sd(obp[position=="IF"])-sd(obp[position=="OF"])) %>%
  pull()
obs
```  

Let's write a function to shuffle the position.

```{r}
perm_stat <- function(x){
  x %>% 
  mutate(position=shuffle(position)) %>%
  summarize(stat=sd(obp[position=="IF"])-sd(obp[position=="OF"])) %>%
  pull()
}
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
set.seed(443)
results<-do(1000)*perm_stat(mlb_prob3)
```

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
results %>% 
  gf_histogram(~perm_stat,fill="cyan",color="black") %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept=obs,color="red") %>%
  gf_theme(theme_classic()) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Sampling distribution of difference in variances",
          subtitle="Randomization permutation test",
          x="Test statistic")
```

The p-value is

```{r}
2*prop1(~(perm_stat>=obs),data=results)
```  

This is a two sided test since we did not know in advance which variance would be larger. We reject the hypothesis of equal variance but the p-value is too close to the significance level. The conclusion is suspect. We need more data.

d. Create a bootstrap distribution of the differences in sample standard deviations, and report a 95\% confidence interval. Compare with part c.  

Let's write a function.

```{r}
var_stat <- function(x){
  resample(x) %>%
  summarize(stat=sd(obp[position=="IF"])-sd(obp[position=="OF"])) %>%
  pull()
}
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
set.seed(827)
results<-do(1000)*var_stat(mlb_prob3)
```

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
results %>% 
  gf_histogram(~var_stat,fill="cyan",color="black") %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept=obs,color="red")%>%
  gf_theme(theme_classic()) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Bootstrap sampling of difference in variances",
          x="Difference in variances")
```
