# Additional Hypothesis Tests {#ADDTESTS}

## Objectives

1) Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test for equality of two or more means using both permutation and the $F$ distribution.   
2) Conduct and interpret a goodness of fit test using both Pearson's chi-squared and randomization to evaluate the independence between two categorical variables.   
3) Conduct and interpret a hypothesis test for the equality of two variances.   
4) Know and check assumptions for the tests in this lesson.

## Homework  

### Problem 1  

**Golf balls**   

Repeat the analysis of the golf ball problem from earlier this semester.


a. Load the data and tally the data into a table. The data is in `golf_balls.csv`.  


```r
golf_balls <- read_csv("data/golf_balls.csv")
```


```r
head(golf_balls)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 1
##   number
##    <dbl>
## 1      3
## 2      2
## 3      1
## 4      4
## 5      4
## 6      3
```



```r
tally(~number,data=golf_balls)
```

```
## number
##   1   2   3   4 
## 137 138 107 104
```


b. Using the function `chisq.test` conduct a hypothesis test of equally likely distribution of balls. You may have to read the help menu. 



```r
chisq.test(tally(~number,data=golf_balls),p=c(.25,.25,.25,.25))
```

```
## 
## 	Chi-squared test for given probabilities
## 
## data:  tally(~number, data = golf_balls)
## X-squared = 8.4691, df = 3, p-value = 0.03725
```


c. Repeat part b. but assume balls with the numbers 1 and 2 occur 30\% of the time and balls with 3 and 4 occur 20\%. 


```r
chisq.test(tally(~number,data=golf_balls),p=c(.3,.3,.2,.2))
```

```
## 
## 	Chi-squared test for given probabilities
## 
## data:  tally(~number, data = golf_balls)
## X-squared = 2.4122, df = 3, p-value = 0.4914
```


### Problem 2

**Bootstrap hypothesis testing**  

Repeat the analysis of the MLB data from the lesson but this time generate a bootstrap distribution of the $F$ statistic.

First, read in the data.


```r
mlb_obp <- read_csv("data/mlb_obp.csv")
```

Convert `position` to a factor.


```r
mlb_obp <- mlb_obp %>%
  mutate(position=as.factor(position))
```

Summarize the data.


```r
favstats(obp~position,data=mlb_obp)
```

```
##   position   min      Q1 median      Q3   max      mean         sd   n missing
## 1        C 0.219 0.30000 0.3180 0.35700 0.405 0.3226154 0.04513175  39       0
## 2       DH 0.287 0.31625 0.3525 0.36950 0.412 0.3477857 0.03603669  14       0
## 3       IF 0.174 0.30800 0.3270 0.35275 0.437 0.3315260 0.03709504 154       0
## 4       OF 0.265 0.31475 0.3345 0.35300 0.411 0.3342500 0.02944394 120       0
```

We need a function to resample the data, we will use the `resample()` from the `mosaic` package.



```r
library(broom)
```


```r
f_boot <- function(x){
  aov(obp~position,data=resample(x)) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  summarize(stat=meansq[1]/meansq[2]) %>%
  pull()
}
```



```r
set.seed(541)
results<-do(1000)*f_boot(mlb_obp)
```

Let's plot our sampling distribution.


```r
results %>%
  gf_histogram(~f_boot,fill="cyan",color="black") %>%
  gf_theme(theme_classic()) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Bootstrap sampling distribution of F test statistic",
          x="Test statistic")
```

<img src="24-Additional-Hypothesis-Tests-Solutions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" />

Now the confidence interval for the F-statistic is:


```r
cdata(~f_boot,data=results)
```

```
##          lower    upper central.p
## 2.5% 0.3546682 8.724895      0.95
```

We are 95\% confident that the $F$ statistic is in the interval $(0.35,8.72)$ which includes 1 so we fail to reject the null hypothesis of equal means. Remember under the null hypothesis the ratio of the variance between means to the pooled variance within categories should be 1. 

### Problem 3  

**Test of variance**

We have not performed a test of variance so we will create our own.

a. Using the MLB from the lesson, subset on `IF` and `OF`.  


```r
mlb_prob3 <- mlb_obp %>%
  filter(position=="IF"|position=="OF") %>%
  droplevels()
```


```r
summary(mlb_prob3)
```

```
##  position      obp        
##  IF:154   Min.   :0.1740  
##  OF:120   1st Qu.:0.3100  
##           Median :0.3310  
##           Mean   :0.3327  
##           3rd Qu.:0.3530  
##           Max.   :0.4370
```

The function `droplevels()` gets rid of `C` and `DH` in the factor levels.

b. Create a side-by-side boxplot.


```r
mlb_prob3 %>%
  gf_boxplot(obp~position) %>%
  gf_theme(theme_classic())
```

<img src="24-Additional-Hypothesis-Tests-Solutions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" />

The hypotheses are:  
$H_0$: $\sigma^2_{IF}=\sigma^2{OF}$. There is no difference in the variance of on base percentage for infielders and outfielders.  
$H_A$: $\sigma^2_{IF}\neq \sigma^2_{OF}$. There is a difference in variances.
 
c. Use the differences in sample standard deviations as your test statistic. Using a permutation test, find the p-value and discuss your decision.  


```r
mlb_prob3 %>%
  group_by(position) %>%
  summarize(stat=sd(obp))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   position   stat
##   <fct>     <dbl>
## 1 IF       0.0371
## 2 OF       0.0294
```



```r
obs <- mlb_prob3 %>%
  summarize(stat=sd(obp[position=="IF"])-sd(obp[position=="OF"])) %>%
  pull()
obs
```

```
## [1] 0.007651101
```

Let's write a function to shuffle the position.


```r
perm_stat <- function(x){
  x %>% 
  mutate(position=shuffle(position)) %>%
  summarize(stat=sd(obp[position=="IF"])-sd(obp[position=="OF"])) %>%
  pull()
}
```


```r
set.seed(443)
results<-do(1000)*perm_stat(mlb_prob3)
```


```r
results %>% 
  gf_histogram(~perm_stat,fill="cyan",color="black") %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept=obs,color="red") %>%
  gf_theme(theme_classic()) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Sampling distribution of difference in variances",
          subtitle="Randomization permutation test",
          x="Test statistic")
```

<img src="24-Additional-Hypothesis-Tests-Solutions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="672" />

The p-value is


```r
2*prop1(~(perm_stat>=obs),data=results)
```

```
##  prop_TRUE 
## 0.04395604
```

This is a two sided test since we did not know in advance which variance would be larger. We reject the hypothesis of equal variance but the p-value is too close to the significance level. The conclusion is suspect. We need more data.

d. Create a bootstrap distribution of the differences in sample standard deviations, and report a 95\% confidence interval. Compare with part c.  

Let's write a function.


```r
var_stat <- function(x){
  resample(x) %>%
  summarize(stat=sd(obp[position=="IF"])-sd(obp[position=="OF"])) %>%
  pull()
}
```


```r
set.seed(827)
results<-do(1000)*var_stat(mlb_prob3)
```


```r
results %>% 
  gf_histogram(~var_stat,fill="cyan",color="black") %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept=obs,color="red")%>%
  gf_theme(theme_classic()) %>%
  gf_labs(title="Bootstrap sampling of difference in variances",
          x="Difference in variances")
```
